AGREP for OS/2

This version of Agrep has been updated to allow for wildcard support for 
OS/2 file names, and also has some changes to the options for ease of use
(see documentation in main.c). 

Please read the "copyrite" file for information on other considerations 
before making this available internally to IBM. 

Also, the code could use some tidying up, but is presented here "asis"
for others to enjoy and use.
